    "INFO_1": {
      "HEADER": "Do you want to learn how to program games?",
      "BODY": "<p class=\"line-height-150\">Then you are right here.</p><p class=\"line-height-150\">Perhaps you read somewhere that it would be very exhausting and time-consuming to write your own computer games. You would have to learn a complicated programming language first, deal with a lot of math and take months to produce small graphic demos. But that's not true.</p>"
    },
    "INFO_2": "Game Programming is easy!",
    "INFO_3": "<p class=\"line-height-150\">At least if you do it right.</p><p class=\"line-height-150\">With BlitzBasicScript you will discover the fascination of game development in a playful way from the very first minute. Are you curious and want to explore all the cool ways you can create living virtual worlds? Twelve tutorials are waiting for you, in which you will learn in no time how to conjure up graphics on the screen, play sound effects and move 3D objects.</p><p class=\"line-height-150\">Or do you want to get started right away without getting bored with any theory? Then just open a demo project of your choice and try it out! Use the integrated development environment to examine the code line by line and change things as you like. In this way, you can quickly and intuitively see how a computer game works under the hood - learning by doing.</p><p class=\"line-height-150\">And if you do reach your limits and don't know what to do next, no problem: Simply mark a code area and activate the coding guide. It will help you better understand commands and keywords and comprehend the underlying mechanisms.</p>",
    "SIX_REASONS": "Six reasons for BlitzBasicScript",
    "REASON_1": {
      "HEADER": "Simple Programming Language",
      "BODY": "BlitzBasicScript is a further development of the legendary game programming language BlitzBasic, which was invented by the New Zealand computer scientist Mark Sibly. The syntax - the way commands and code structures look - is very easy to read and understand. You don't have to learn abstract concepts, just write line by line in your program what exactly should happen. Draw a picture on the monitor, play background music, make the figure jump up when you click the space bar!"
    },
    "REASON_2": {
      "HEADER": "Integrated Development Environment",
      "BODY": "You don't have to install programs or buy licenses to create your games. All you need is a browser and an internet connection. Use the integrated development environment (Online IDE) to write and manage your source code. If you have a free account at blitzbasicscript.com, you can access your projects from any device and share them with the community."
    },
    "REASON_3": {
      "HEADER": "Lots of Examples, Tutorials and Documentation",
      "BODY": "Why start from scratch instead of having fun? Forget about colorless text or maths treatises - start trying small pre-built games and researching their code right away. In no time at all, you'll learn what to do to bring your creative ideas to life without reinventing the wheel. A small collection of clear tutorials will help you to understand the basic principles of game programming and to apply them directly. And if you want to know exactly, take a look at the extensive documentation of the commands and keywords!"
    },
    "REASON_4": {
      "HEADER": "Long-Term Success of BlitzBasic",
      "BODY": "At the beginning of the new millennium, three programming languages ​​appeared with BlitzBasic, Blitz3D and BlitzPlus, which essentially have a lot in common. Creative 2D and 3D games can be developed with just a few commands. The so-called Blitz languages ​​were very successful internationally and hundreds of games were created, whose source code often still exists today. All the advantages of these languages ​​have been bundled in BlitzBasicScript and enhanced with the help of the latest graphics technology. You can also simply import the old classics on blitzbasicscript.com and play them directly in your browser!"
    },
    "REASON_5": {
      "HEADER": "Open Source",
      "BODY": "BlitzBasicScript is completely open source and the source code of this project can be viewed or used on GitHub. All you have to do is register for free and accept the terms of use to be able to save your projects in the cloud. Our philosophy is maximum freedom for all game developers: Benefit from the knowledge of others and in return make your projects available to the community. So everyone can learn and discover new things again and again. By the way, you always own the copyright to your games!"
    },
    "REASON_6": {
      "HEADER": "Collect trophies and win contests",
      "BODY": "Make programming your own game: Register for free with BlitzBasicScript and become part of a lively community! Learn about new commands & data structures and incorporate them into your code to receive valuable trophies and medals. You can also take part in cool competitions and compete with others. In this way you improve your skills continuously and easily."
